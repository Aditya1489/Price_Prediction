# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
This project uses machine learning models to predict real estate prices in Bangalore, India, based on a dataset of relevant features.

## Introduction
The data represents real estate properties in Bangalore and includes various features that influence property prices. The project uses a clean and simple approach to predict property prices based on characteristics such as location, total area, number of bedrooms, and other critical features.

## Data
* **train.csv:** The training dataset used for building the model.
* ### test.csv: The testing dataset for validating the model.
* ### data_description.txt: A detailed description of the dataset columns and their significance.
* ### sample_submission.csv: An example submission file that showcases the expected output format.
  
## How to use
* Clone this repository.
* Install the required dependencies.
* Run the bangalore_price_prediction.ipynb notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Dependencies
* pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
